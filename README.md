# Adventure-Game
Project Overview In this project, you'll make a simpler version of an old-fashioned text-based adventure game. You can find an example in the workspace below. Try it out to get a feeling for how the game works!  In order to build a program like this, we should first completely understand what it does. Take a notepad out, and play the game multiple times. The game will present you some scenarios and ask you to make one of 2 choices, by entering 1 or 2. In your notepad, record what happens each time you make a certain choice.
